# Hannah's Portfolio Landing Page

by Hannah McDowell

*A simple website to view all of my portfolio projects.*

## Description
This webpage contains information about me and a list of projects I've created.

## Technologies/Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local device
2. Clone this repository onto your local device: `git clone [repo link]`
3. Open the cloned repository
4. Navigate to the top level of the directory
5. Open the `index.html` file using any internet browser to see the webpage

## Known Bugs
* The navigation bar needs a [toggler](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#toggler) so all options are visible when the window is resized.
* The layout for the Portfolio Projects section uses a class called [card-group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-groups) in Bootstrap, which is not responsive. 

## Future Features
I hope to add:
* Icons to the navigation bar
* A toggler to the navigation bar
* Icons to the card footers in the portfolio section
* Images for each portfolio project
* Browser icon
